## :page_with_curl: About test

This repository contains the Pokédex frontend.

## :books: Requirements of test

The purpose of the test was to have the following features:

- List of Pokémons on the main page

- Capable of filtering by name

- List of favorite Pokémons

- The API can be mocked on the browser’s local storage

- Code commits either by providing the .git folder or a public repo

## :rocket: Requirements to execute the project

- Typescript React version 4.x

- NodeJS version +12.x

```bash
  # Install dependencies:
  $ yarn install

  # Run the project:
  $ yarn start

  # Run end-to-end tests - Cypress:
  $ yarn cypress or yarn cypress:open
```

# Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Create a Pokédex that will allow the user to see a list of Pokémons and save its favorites on a separate list.

The application must provide:

- List of Pokémons on the main page
  - Capable of filtering by name
- List of favorite Pokémons
  - The API can be mocked on the browser’s local storage
- Code commits either by providing the .git folder or a public repo
- Automated tests are a good addition but they are not mandatory

The API that should be used to get the data is https://pokeapi.co/. We provide the request functions at `src/services` but feel free to modify them as you need.

Suggested designs (the design does not need to be perfect, it only illustrates the idea):
